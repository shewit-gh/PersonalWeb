                            list some of them. I really admire people who read books and i advice those who
                            do not to read because it is good to explore.

                    <h2>The Topeka School, Ben Lerner </h2>
                    <p>
                        The novelist, essayist and poet blends the perspectives of a quick and ruthless
                        high school debate champion, his psychologist parents and a misfit peer in The
                        Topeka School, a poignant examination of “toxic masculinity” and its
                        manifestations in speech. Adam Gordon, a character first introduced as a grown
                        man and a poet in Lerner’s debut novel Leaving the Atocha Station, is a slick
                        talker, a chameleon as comfortable dominating his school’s social scene as he is
                        in his parents’ home. Adam’s winning approach to competition—subjecting his
                        challengers to “the spread,” where they’re forced to respond to a blast of ideas
                        at the pace of drinking from a firehose—deftly reflects the demise of civil discourse.

                    <h2>Where Reasons End, Yiyun Li</h2>
                    <p>
                        A devastating story born of real-life heartbreak, Yiyun Li’s Where Reasons End
                        places a mother in conversation with her son after losing him to suicide. Li
                        wrote her highly original and deeply affecting novel in the wake of her own
                        son’s suicide. In the book, the narrator visits with 16-year-old Nikolai in a
                        liminal world of Li’s creation, somewhere between the realms of the living and
                        the dead. As the two relive their old ways of being together and speaking to one
                        another, Li unfolds a moving meditation on the limitations of language—a tool
                        that is equipped to relay neither life’s most harrowing pain nor its fiercest love.

                    <h2>Trust Exercise, Susan Choi</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the hormone-laden and pressure-fueled world of a performing arts high
                            school, two acting students get locked in a heady romance—only to be watched,
                            judged and influenced by their peers and even their drama teacher, a man with
                            questionable motives. National Book Award winner Susan Choi crafts a visceral
                            adolescent world rife with tension, sexual and otherwise, and renders the
                            insecurity that accompanies it with excruciating realism. That is, until she
                            introduces a shift in perspective midway through the novel that undermines
                            the veracity of the story. With a boldly unconventional structure, Choi points
                            to essential truths about power and who gets to control the narrative.

                    <h2>The Need, Helen Phillips</h2>
                        <p>
                            It’s a classic opening: a woman hears an intruder in her home while her
                            husband is away, grabs her two young kids and hides in terror. But the true
                            power of Helen Phillips’ brilliantly paced thriller emerges when Molly, a
                            paleobotanist, comes face to face with the only person in the world who can
                            shake her identity as a mother—a person who brings her to question her very
                            reality. Phillips taps into the overwhelming anxiety that comes with love in its
                            deepest, truest form, a sense of fierce protectiveness one need not be a parent
                            to understand.
